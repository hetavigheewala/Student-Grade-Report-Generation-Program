# Student-Grade-Report-Generation-Program

This C++ program reads student data from a file, calculates averages and grades, and generates a comprehensive student grade report. It uses a structure to store student records containing their last name, five test scores, average, and grade. The program reads data from a file, calculates average scores, assigns letter grades, and prints a report. It also identifies the best and poorest performing students based on average scores. The program includes functions to perform these tasks, ensuring modular code organization. The final output is a well-formatted student grade report displaying individual scores, averages, and grades, along with class average and best/worst performance information.
